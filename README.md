# Pokedex: An Introduction to the React Router

[**Live Demo!**](http://aa-pokedex.herokuapp.com/)

In this project, we'll write an app to manage your `Pokemon` and their `Toys`.

We've already setup a Rails backend with migrations/models/controllers/views for you to start with in the [skeleton][skeleton-zip].  **You will need to run `bundle install`, then `rake db:setup` (short for `rake
db:create db:migrate db:seed`).**

Take a look at the schema, the routes file, and the jbuilder views to get
yourself oriented.  Start up the rails server and visit the api routes to see what
data are available from the backend.   

**Note the `defaults: {format: :json}`** in the `routes.rb` file.  This means HTTP
requests for the `pokemon` resource should be assumed to be asking for a
JSON response instead of HTML. When we render a template, instead of looking for `template.html.erb`, Rails will look for `template.json.jbuilder`.

Stylesheets have been provided for you in the skeleton.  Follow the sample jsx structures provided in the instructions to have these stylings applied.  


[skeleton-zip]: ./skeleton.zip?raw=true

## Phase 1: NPM and Webpack

### `Node Package Manager`

As with previous projects, you will need to set up `package.json` and `webpack.config.js` files to configure your application to use NPM and Webpack. First, run `npm init -f` to initialize `package.json` with the default settings. Instead of proceeding to run `npm install --save <package-name>` to install dependencies, we want to use specific versions of each package. To that end, add (or replace if it already exists) a "dependencies" key in the `package.json` file with the following:

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "babel-loader": "^6.2.4",
    "babel-core": "^6.13.2",
    "babel-preset-es2015": "^6.13.2",
    "babel-preset-react": "^6.11.1",
    "lodash": "^4.15.0",
    "react-redux": "^4.4.5",
    "react": "^15.3.0",
    "react-dom": "^15.3.0",
    "react-router": "^2.6.1",
    "redux": "^3.5.2",
    "webpack": "^1.13.1"
  }
```

Run `npm install` to generate your `node_modules` folder.

### `Webpack`

Next we need to configure Webpack to compile our `bundle.js` file. Create a new
file called `webpack.config.js` in the root of your project and add the
following content:

```js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  context: __dirname,
  entry: './frontend/pokedex.jsx',
  output: {
    path: path.join(__dirname, 'app', 'assets', 'javascripts'),
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['', '.js', '.jsx']
  },
  module: {
    loaders: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        exclude: /(node_modules|bower_components)/,
        loader: 'babel',
        query: {
          presets: ['react', 'es2015']
        }
      },
      {
        test: /\.node$/,
        loader: 'node-loader'
      }
    ]
  },
  devtool: 'source-maps'
};
```

Now that Webpack knows to create `bundle.js`, we need to require it in our
`application.js`:

```js
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require bundle
```

Notice that the `entry` key in `webpack.config.js` expects a file called
`./frontend/pokedex.jsx` to exist. Make the `frontend` folder in the root of
your project and add a file called `pokedex.jsx`. This is going to be the
starting point for the rest of your app. Make sure to import both the `'react'`
and `'react-dom'` packages, and then add an event listener for
`DOMContentLoaded`.  In the callback to this listener, try rendering a simple stateless functional React component to test out everything you've written so far. Don't forget to run `webpack --watch` to generate your `app/assets/javascripts/bundle.js`.

Next, add more structure to your `frontend` directory. You should have folders for actions, components, reducers, store, middleware and util.

## Phase 2: The Pokemon Index

### From API to Action Creator

We'd like to render a list of Pokemon. Let's start by setting up a way to fetch
them from the back end. Make an `api_util.js` file inside your util folder.
Inside this file, we'll make ajax requests that fetch information served by our
rails controllers, and on success dispatch an action creator.

Export a function called `fetchAllPokemon` that takes in a success callback as an argument. The function should make an AJAX request that will serve up the `index.json.jbuilder` view for Pokemon.  Check out the `routes.rb` file and run `rake routes` to determine the appropriate url for this request.

Now let's write the success callback that will be passed to this function.  Create a `pokemon_actions.js` file within the actions folder and import the ajax request function we just wrote.  **Hint:** `import * as API from ./util/api_util.js` is a nice way to just import all of the api util functions as methods of an API object!

In our newly created `pokemon_actions.js` file, let's start by exporting a `PokemonConstants`
objects with a key-value pair for `"RECEIVE_ALL_POKEMON"`.  Next, export a function called `receiveAllPokemon` that returns a pure object. This object should have two keys: one for the a `RECEIVE_ALL_POKEMON` action type and another for the Pokemon data.

**Import the action and api_util files in your entry file to test everything works**.  Remember, our action creator just returns an object.  In order to verify that we indeed received all the Pokemon, we can wrap it in a `console.log`:

```javascript
API.fetchAllPokemon((pokemon) => console.log(ACTIONS.receiveAllPokemon(pokemon)));
```

### The Reducer

Remember that the reducer is only concerned with describing how state changes as a result of a dispatched action. In our case this will be the `receiveAllPokemon` action. Create a `pokemon_reducer.js` file that exports a function implementing a switch statement to catch the `action.type`. Refer to these action types by importing the `PokemonConstants` object from the action creator file.

Remember, the reducer function should take two parameters: the `oldState` (defaulting to an empty object) and the action being dispatched. It should then return the new state, without changing the `oldState` object.  Assure that the default case for the reducer switch statement is to return the `oldState`.

The [Lodash merge](lodash-docs) function is a helpful addition to avoid mutating even nested arrays and objects.

[lodash-docs]: https://lodash.com/docs

**Before we can test the reducer we need a store to dispatch from.**

### Store

Create a `store.js` file within the store folder.  Remember, the store contains a reference to this single complete state tree for use by our container components. This is made trivial by importing `{ createStore } from 'redux'`.

The `createStore` function takes the reducer, any `preloadedState`, and any enhancers such as middleware. For now just pass it the imported `pokemon_reducer` and we will come back to the other arguments later.

Wrap the creating of the store in a `configureStore` function. This is a great pattern to get used to, instead of just exporting the store we are exporting a function that creates the store. This can be used in the future to swap out reducers, `preloadedState`, or enhancers depending on certain conditions.

Head back to the `pokedex.jsx` entry file, import your `configureStore` function and call it inside the DOM listener callback. Now replace the logging of your `receiveAllPokemon` success callback with a dispatching using the store.

Test that this dispatches the action to our reducer and updates the state by placing the store on the window at the end of the listener and calling `getState()` in your console.

Now let's pass the store to our root component as a prop.  Inside the root component modify your function to receive a parameter `({ store })`.

If we try to read the state of our store, what is going to happen? Talk this over with your partner before moving on.

### Connect

In order to have our component render after the state is updated we have to subscribe our component to our state. We can easily do this using the `react-redux` bindings.

Remember that there are two types of components in the modern discussion of React/Redux: presentational components and container components. Our container components are concerned with subscribing to the store, reading from state, and passing down necessary props to our presentational components. Our presentational components will only be concerned with rendering JSX and providing functionality to the user interface.

Within `frontend/components/pokemon/`, create a `pokemon_index_container.js` file. As with all container components, we will need to `import { connect } from 'react-redux'`.  

The connect function takes two main arguments: `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps`. Mapping state to props will subscribe the component to the Redux store updates. Anytime the store changes, `mapStateToProps` will be called and return a plain object that is merged into the componentâ€™s props.

```javascript
const mapStateToProps = state => ({
  // piece of state to subscribe to
});
```

Mapping dispatch to props is used mainly just to keep our presentational components from having to worry about dispatching actions. This function expects to be passed action creators that it then wraps in the dispatch function and merges each into the component's props for direct invocation.

This introduces a problem. According to our React/Redux pattern, components are only supposed to manipulate state through the dispatching of actions. They should not be making AJAX requests to our server. We need a way to dispatch a request action that will then perform the AJAX fetch.

Talk over a plan to solve this problem with your partner before writing your `mapDispatchToProps` function.

```javascript
const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({
  // request action
});
```

After writing your mapping functions, pass them to the connect function and then invoke the connect function by passing it a `PokemonIndex` presentational component, which we will write next.

Now let's write the `PokemonIndex` presentational component, which will render an unordered list of Pokemon names next to corresponding images. Write a `componentDidMount` lifecycle method that calls the `requestAllPokemon` action from its props.
If you have not already, create the corresponding request action in your actions file.

Before we move on, import the container component into your entry file and nest a `<PokemonIndexContainer />` within your root component.

### Middleware

The answer to our problem of components not directly communicating with our server is to have them dispatch an action that is intercepted by a middleware. The middleware will then perform the AJAX request and decide whether to pass the action along to the reducer.

Create a `pokemon_middleware.js` file that imports the necessary actions and api util functions. Go ahead and remove those imports from your entry file that we used for testing.  Write a `PokemonMiddleware` function that makes the API call to fetch Pokemon when `"REQUEST_ALL_POKEMON"` is dispatched.   

Remember that the middleware will resemble the reducer in that it will be a switch statement that intercepts actions based on their type. The parameters of the middleware are written in a way that allows it to receive and pass along the actions using `next`. Make sure to call `next(action)` as the default of the switch statement to make sure actions uncaught by the middleware still make it to the reducer. We can pass the middleware the dispatch action as well in order to wrap our success callback actions.

```javascript
export default ({ dispatch }) => next => action => {
  // middlware switch statement and necessary variables
};
```

In order to properly configure the new middleware with the store we will have to add the remaining paramaters to our `CreateStore` call in the `configureStore` function. Import and pass the applied middleware using the `applyMiddleware` function from `redux`.

**Test that your PokemonIndex component now renders some pokemon**

```html
<section className="pokedex">
  <ul>
    {// mapping of Pokemon list elements}
  </ul>
</section>
```

### Provider

We could continue to pass the store down as props to whatever components need to subscribe to it, but that wouldn't be very DRY. This is where another function from the `react-redux` library comes in: The Provider.

Refactor your root component out into it's own file and `import { Provider } from 'react-redux';`

Wrap your `<PokemonIndexContainer>` in a `<Provider>` component that receives the store as a prop. Export this back to your entry file and make sure everything is still rendering correctly.

## The Router

Now let's say we want the ability to click on any of these Pokemon and see more details about them. In order to maintain a common user interface used around the web, we will have the URL define what components the user sees render. This is exactly what the powerful React Router library is for. To use it, `import { Router, Route, hashHistory } from 'react-router';` at the top of our `root.jsx` file.  We will handle all routing decisions within our root component.  

Within our provider, we will nest everything within `<Router>` tags.  We need to pass the router `hashHistory`, tells the router what type of history we will be using to keep track of our locations and pathnames. Another option is `browserHistory`, but it requires extra backend configuration so we will prefer `hashHistory` in this course.  Your code should resemble the following:

```html
  <Provider store={store}>
    <Router history={hashHistory}>
      // routes will go here
    </Router>
  </Provider>
```

Next, instead of rendering the `PokemonIndexContainer` directly, setup a route that will render the component when `path="/"`. This will assure that the Pokemon index is rendered no matter what our pathname is.

The React Router allows us to do some refactoring of our `PokemonIndex` component with the use of the [onEnter][on-enter] function.  This function is called when the route is entered, so instead of dispatching the `requestAllPokemon` action in the `PokemonIndex` component we can call it on entrance of the `/` route. Write this function.

Now you can refactor the `PokemonIndex` to be a stateless functional component that does not need to call any React lifecycle methods. We also do not need to
`mapDispatchToProps` anymore which simplifies our `PokemonIndexContainer`.

**Make sure all Pokemon still render before moving on.**

[on-enter]: https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/blob/master/docs/API.md#onenternextstate-replace-callback

### Pokemon Index Item

Let's refactor each of our Pokemon into their own `PokemonIndexItem` components. This is a great pattern for keeping our components minimal. Now the list will only care about rendering all of the list items and the items will care about the functionality of showing their details.

We will structure the index item components to receive all their information through props.  This way they do not need lifecycle methods and will work perfectly as stateless functional components. Write a `<PokemonIndexItem>` component and refactor `<PokemonIndex>` to utilize this new component.  Test to ensure everything still renders as it did before.  

In order to pass a reference to the router we wrap a component in what is referred to as an HOC (Higher Order Component). These components, much like our containers, serve only to pass down information through props. To implement this we `import { withRouter } from 'react-router'` and then call this function on our component when we export it: `export default withRouter(ComponentName)`.  Add this code to your `PokemonIndexItem`, making sure to add `router` to the props.

Now the component has a reference to the router and all of its information & functions. One such function will be our most useful when implementing navigation: `router.push(url)`.

Create a `_handleClick` function in the `<PokemonIndexItem>` that receives the router and a url. Pass this function to an `onClick` prop of our list elements and test that when clicking a `pokemonIndexItem` you are taken to a path resembling `/pokemon/:id`.

While the route will change, you may have noticed the following error in your browser terminal: `[react-router] Location "/pokemon/:id" did not match any routes`.  This tells us that the router was looking for a component to render for that route but was unable to find one. To fix this, let's make a `PokemonDetail` component.

`PokemonIndexItem` example JSX structure:    
```html   
<li className="pokemon-index-item" onClick={}>    
    <span>{}</span>   
    <img src={} alt={}/>    
    <span>{}</span>   
</li>   
```

### Pokemon Detail

Before creating a component, we should always plan out where and how it will get its information. Eventually, we also want the `PokemonDetail` to display the toys that a Pokemon has. Talk over the following questions with your partner:

1. Where will the `PokemonDetail` get it's information from?
2. How will we pass this information to `PokemonDetail`?

Implement the `PokemonDetail` component just like we did the `PokemonIndex`:

1. create an API function that fetches a single Pokemon
2. create actions for both requesting and receiving a single Pokemon
3. update the reducer to respond to the receiving of a Pokemon
4. update the middleware to respond to the requesting of a Pokemon
5. create a `PokemonDetailContainer` that maps `PokemonDetail` to props

Review the `_pokemon.json.jbuilder` file and talk with your partner about how you believe the `PokemonDetail` object will look before we map it to props. Confirm your answer by navigating to the URL in your browser.

You will notice that the toys data are not well formatted for turning into `ToyItem` components.  But this nesting will be helpful later on when we render a `ToyDetail` component, so we will opt to use a selector rather than edit the jBuilder template.  The selector will take state as a parameter and serve as a utility function to return an array of toy objects that we can easily map over. Create this `toy_selector.js` file in the `util` folder.  Provide this piece of state to the props of your `PokemonDetail` component using your imported selector.

6. create a `PokemonDetail` component

Just like the `PokemonIndex`, use an `onEnter` hook in the Route to invoke the `RequestSinglePokemon` action. But this time we will need to pass an ID to the action. Refer to the [`onEnter` documentation][on-enter] to figure out how we get this information.

We recommend you follow the below structure for `PokemonDetail`:
```html
<section className="pokemon-detail">
  <ul>
    <img src={} alt=""/>
      <li><h2>{}</h2></li>
      <li>Type: {}</li>
      <li>Attack: {}</li>
      <li>Defense: {}</li>
      <li>Moves: &#34;{}&#34;</li>
    <section className="toys">
        <h3>Toys</h3>
      <ul className="toy-list">
        {}
      </ul>
    </section>
  </ul>
</section>
```

7. complete the corresponding route that renders the `PokemonDetailContainer`

Nest the `PokemonDetail` route under the route for the `PokemonIndex`.  We will also need to **explicitly tell the `PokemonIndex` component to render it's children** (make sure to pass `children` as a prop). This will ensure that both components will be rendered on the page when at the `"/pokemon/1"` path.

[on-enter]: https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/blob/master/docs/API.md#onenternextstate-replace-callback

### Toy Detail

Implement the ability to click on a Toy and be taken to a path such as `/pokemon/1/toys/1` where a `ToyDetail` component displays information about a Toy below the `PokemonDetail` component. This should be completed without any additional changes to the application state.

When providing the toy to the `ToyDetail` component from the `ToyDetailContainer`, remember that `mapStateToProps` accepts a second parameter `ownProps`. Use this to key into the correct toy.

### Creating Pokemon

Our next feature will be to allow the creation of new Pokemon.

1. Create an API function that posts a single Pokemon
2. Create actions for both creating and receiving a new Pokemon
3. Update the reducer to respond to receiving a new Pokemon
  **Hint:** This should merge multiple pieces of state
4. Update the middleware to respond to creating a Pokemon
5. Create a `PokemonFormContainer` that only connects `mapDispatchToProps`
6. Create a `PokemonForm` controlled component

A controlled component is one which overrides the default functionality of the browser, allowing your code to entirely control your application. This is most commonly used in forms to ensure input field values are being tracked in internal state, and that submit buttons perform actions as described by the application.

Use the `constructor()` method to provide a default internal state to your form. Even though Javascript prefers camelCase, it is often easiest to define data in the format our server expects when making a "POST" request.  In Ruby, this means camel_case.

Normally these constructor functions are taken care of by React. This is how React creates parent/child relationships between components and why we never need to bind child methods. In this case, we are overriding the constructor function to have a default internal state, so it is our responsibility to make sure all functions are properly bound.

```javascript
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      // Internal Default State
    };
    this.exampleMethod = this.exampleMethod.bind(this);
  }
```

For the input elements use an `onChange` listener and write a single `update` function to call the `setState` method.

The best html element for the Pokemon type is a dropdown. In order to get all of the Pokemon types, we have provided a script tag in the `application.html.erb` file which stores an array of types on the window. To maintain the Redux pattern, pass it into your `configureStore` invocation as preloaded state. Then map it to your `PokemonForm` as props.

Sample `PokemonForm` jsx structure:
```html
      <section className="pokemon-detail">
        <img src="/assets/pokemon-logo.png"/>
        <ul>
          {// map list elements for errors with class "error"}
        </ul>
        <form className="pokemon-form" onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
            {// input elements for all but Pokemon types}
            {// use select and option elements for Pokemon types }
          <button>Create Pokemon</button>
        </form>
      </section>
```

Write a `handleSubmit` method as well that prevents the default event action and instead calls the `createPokemon` function from props. Make sure to pass this function to the `onSubmit` listener of the form.

We want this form to appear when at the same root path as the `PokemonIndex`, but not at any further nested routes like the `PokemonDetail`. This is exactly what `IndexRoute` is for. Import it along with the rest of the React Router tools and pass it the `PokemonFormContainer`.

**N.B.** There are a couple of tricky aspects to getting the form to work properly which will be great debugging practice. Use a `debugger` in your `postPokemon` function to ensure that you are always passing the correct parameters to your API. You may need to add a conditional to your update function as well.

The final tricky parts of the Pokemon form are the redirect callback and error handling.

### Redirecting

Once the posting is complete we want the application to redirect to the newly created Pokemon. We need to wait because we need this Pokemon's ID in order to push to that URL. Unfortunately this is one of the downfalls to implementing the react router separate from Redux. We do not have the router as a part of our application state, so instead we suggest using the slightly older way of implementing navigation: `import {hashHistory} from 'react-router';`

This imports a reference to the `hashHistory` object that we can push directly to. Call `hashHistory.push` with the correct url inside of your `postPokemon` success callback.

**Challenge: There is an additional request being made to the server. Plan out with your partner how to fix this and improve your application.**

### Error Handling

The server is great at telling us whether or not our new Pokemon is being inserted into the database correctly, but so far we have no way of letting our users know what happened. We need a way of displaying errors on the front-end after an unsuccessful post request.

1. Add a failure callback to the `createPokemon` function.
2. Add a `pokemonError` action
3. Update the middleware and reducer
4. Add a `mapStateToProps` function that connects in the `PokemonFormContainer`
5. Add an errors function to the `pokemonForm` that returns an unordered list of error messages.

## Bonus

### Loading Spinner

Use `next(action)` in your `PokemonMiddleware` to always ensure the passing of your actions to the reducer. This way you can reduce actions such as `RequestPokemon` in order to describe an intermediary state of your application. Set this state back to normal when reducing `ReceivePokemon` actions.

### Update Toys

Add the ability to reassign toys to different Pokemon.
